 						<h3>Reading poems</h3>
 						Poem is something amazing.It is something that can talk with me when I am sad or feeling  alone.I think that I have a talent for doing this.I started reading poems when I was 4. I read a lot of books with a lot of poems.But I am fanatic of Pushkin's,Erkin Vohidov's, Muhammad Yusuf's and Lermontov's masterpieces.I love the world of poems and cannot image my life without it. </blockquote>

 				<div id="PlayingChess" class="grid-4">
 				
 					<blockquote >
 						<h3>Playing chess</h3>
 						My last hobby is playing chess. Games like chess that challenge the brain actually stimulate the growth of dendrites, the bodies that send out signals from the brain's neuron cells. With more dendrites, neural communication within the brain improves and becomes faster.To get the most benefit from a physical workout, you need to exercise both the left and right sides of your body. </blockquote>
